# Fuzzy Wash
## Intro
A project demonstrating a fuzzy controlled washing machine. The objective is to design a system which improves factors like performance, productivity, simplicity, and reduces cost. Sensors continually monitor varying conditions inside the machine and accordingly adjust operations for the best wash results.

The process is based entirely on the principle of taking non-precise inputs from the sensors, subjecting them to fuzzy arithmetic and obtaining a crisp value of the washing time.

## Fuzzy parameters
The fuzzy logic checks for the extent of dirt and grease, the amount of soap and water to add, direction of spin, and so on.

No two Fuzzy Logic systems are alike, and brands typically vary the parameters sensed in the washing machine. But generally speaking, the following are usually the variables taken into consideration:

- The weight of the load
- The type of fabric
- The amount and temperature of the water
- The amount of detergent
- The dirt in the water or rinse needs
- The type and length of agitation needed
- The speed and duration of the spin cycle
