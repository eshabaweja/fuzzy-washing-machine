# Fuzzy Wash
## Intro
A project demonstrating a fuzzy controlled washing machine. The objective is to design a system which improves factors like performance, productivity, simplicity, and reduces cost. Sensors continually monitor varying conditions inside the machine and accordingly adjust operations for the best wash results.

The process is based entirely on the principle of taking non-precise inputs from the sensors, subjecting them to fuzzy arithmetic and obtaining a crisp value of the washing time.
